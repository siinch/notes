Q1: The NotPetya attack on Maersk - how did the attack begin, how did it spread, and how was encryption used?
-active outside attack disruptive attack
-MeDoc server
-EternalBlue exploit
-used symmetric (fast) encryption AES
-symmetric key encrypted or destroyed

Q2: What are the lessons for organizing IT security based on the NotPetya attack?
-Shut down or monitor equipment
-check hash value
-Keep independent ansynchronous backups
-Create/update securty policy/plan
-Update regularly, but not immediately
-perhaps use linux or run in lower privilege mode

﻿Q3: "Hybrid encryption model” of ransomware
1. inject ransomware with public key
2. generate symmetric key
3. encrypt symmetric key and send to attacker
4. encrypt victims files with symmetric key (fast)
5. delete/encrypt symmetric key
6. demand ransom
(7.) provide symmetric key when ransom is paid

Q4: Taxonomy of ransomware.
-Categories -rank (fake)1-6(perfect)
Examples
-Petya (5-6)
-WannaCry (~3)
Encryption
-Symmetric
-Asymmetric

Q5: Advantages and disadvantages of biometric authentification.
verify claimed identity
4 types: knows, has, is(static), does(dynamic)
pro:
-user does not have to remember
-hard to fake (physically)
-cannot be cracked
con:
-Cannot be changed if stolen
-not 100% reliable
-costly
Other typical means of authentication
-passwords
-asymmetric encryption + PKI
-2 factor

Q6: Privacy issues of digital passports. “Basic access control” and “Extended access control” in EU's standard.
1. Readers should authenticate themselves first:
  - readers can self-authenticate
2. Consent by the passport holders
  - leak of some data can be exploited
3. Proof of integrity and authenticity
  - fixed with EAC
Improvements
- avoid contactless cards
- online terminals

Q7: What is a digital certificate, and how may it be used in a PKI (Public Key Infrastrucutre)?
Certificate:
-meta info (varies depending on standard)
-public key of certificate holder
-signature (hashed certificate encrypted with PRca)
-Now people can trust the certificate if they have PUca
-they can verify PU(s)ender with a random test
 - if sender accurately decrypts eg. a number

Q8: What is a buffer overflow?
- a methods of overwriting data by exploiting the way programs allocate memory
- memory assigned to buffer greater than memory allocated
- prevent with bounds checking, build into Java
- used in Code Red to install worms on vulnerable servers
- drive green: restrict use of unsafe languages such as c

Q9: "What are the most important aspects of GDPR for an existing organization and how would/should you introduce and maintain GDPR in such an organization?"
 - overall limitations
 - consent and interests
 - special categories
 - Individual rights
 - drive green: Inform, Control, Enforce, Demonstate (Authoriy, controller subject)

Q10: "How can Privacy (PbD and Design Strategies) influence the design of an IT system (eg. if you should design the IT systems of DriveGreen)?"
 - Software development lifecycle with privacy
 - Separate (more tables)
 - Hide (hide tables)
 - Abstract (user ids)
 - Minimize (omit)

Q11: "What is the major objectives (and content) of a Security Policy for an organization?
-Policy -> Analysis(plan) -> implementation -> follow-up
-Objectives:
 - CIAAAR (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Accountability, Authenticity, Reliability)
-Content(scope): what who how when why
-Drive green: Ceo, CISO.. Roskilde Kommune, EU.. Servers, databases, training.. every year, gdpr

Q12: "What is the main elements of a Detailed Security Risk Assessment and how would you conduct it as a CISO(Chief Information Security Officer) of a smaller organization?"
-Policy -> Analysis(plan) -> implementation -> follow-up
Then do detailed assessment:
Step 1: Prepare for Assessement
 - identify assets
 - identify context (vulnerbility scale)
 - risk appetite
Step 2: Conduct Risk Analysis
 - threats to assets
 - vulnerbilities
 - likelihood (1 - 5) 14.2
 - consequences (1 - 6) 14.3
 - determine risk ((likelihood * cost)/30)*3 + 1  (1 - 4) 14.4
Step 3: Communicate Results
 - some sort of report
Step 4: Maintain Assessment
 - review, repeat

Q13: "Security Implementation Plan - Why, What, How?"
-Policy -> Analysis(plan) -> implementation -> follow-up
- What
    Risk Asset/Threat, Level of Risk ,Recommended Controls
- Why
    Priority, Selected Controls
- How
    Resources, People, Dates
- Maintenance - review plan once in a while

Q14: "What is an Internet/E-mail security policy and what would it contain for a smaller company (eg. DriveGreen)?"
Policies specific for internet and email use
 - Business use only
 - Privacy
 - Standard of Conduct
 - Security Policy
 - Disciplinary Action

Q15: "TCP SYN attacks - and how to defend against them"
- TCP
Explanation:
 - Client(s) sends many "SYN"-requests. (Distributed) Denial of Service.
 - Server is left waiting for ACKS
Solution:
 - Configure firewall to block IPs sending many SYN requests but no ACKS
Weakness:
 - IP Spoofing (supply fake IP address)

Q16: "TLS Heartbleed attacks - and how to defend against them"
- TLS symmetric + asymmetric encryption + certificates
- heartbeat request/response  (are you there?/i am here)
- Send malformed payload in request from client
- receive password, certificates, private info etc. in response from server
- always reject malformed IDs / fill with blanks / update OpenSSL

Q17: "What are the main security challenges of wireless networks?”
Wireless networks are convenient
drive green case:
 - Rogue access points
 - Rogue end points (wardriving)
 - Badly Configured Mobile Devices
 - Bad habits
 - Badly configured routers

Q18: "What are the main security countermeasures to wireless security threats?”
 - hide network SSID (name)
 - Reduce signal strength
 - upgrade to WPA3
 - Alternative: use ethernet (wired connections)
 - Use positive/negative lists
 - secure endpoints with tls, update and antivirus


Q19: Passwords. Discuss passwords, password tables and attacks on password tables. In particular, discuss attacks based on password dictionaries and rainbow tables.
-Password table: user salt hash
-password dictionary attack: brute-force one account using guess + salt
-rainbow table attack: precomputed hashes, search and compare
   disadvantage: very long
-Use salts, strong passwords
-updated hash algorithms like sha256 (layered)

Q20: "Describe important, current data ethical dilemmas and how an ethical code of conduct can address them?"
-example: more surveillance or not?
-Issues: Corruption, Misunderstanding, Lacking awareness
-Ethical Hierarchy: Humanity, Professionalism, Each profession
-ACM Code of Conduct: General -> Specific -> Organization -> Compliance
